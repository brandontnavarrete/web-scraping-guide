# web-scraping-guide
This started as a way to learn web scraping for the sake of learning. Then I realized what issues can arrive and how many different ways a single problem can be resolved. Here, I've created a guide for my own use and the use of there's who are interested in working with API's

# Project Description

  * For this project, I will be documenting my process of locating an API, exploring its features, and identifying potential     issues. My goal is to create a markdown file that others can follow along with, allowing them to see my thought process        and    approach to working with APIs.

    * In order to make this project as useful as possible, I will also be creating a reproducible deliverable that others can       use to replicate my results. This will involve documenting the steps I took to locate and test the API, as well as any        challenges I encountered along the way.

      * Throughout the project, I will be open to communication and feedback from others. I welcome any suggestions or            insights       that can help me improve my approach, as well as any questions or comments that others may have about my       work. By             working together in this way, I believe we can create a valuable resource for anyone interested in       working with APIs.

# Project Goals
  * The aim of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of web scraping and the challenges that are often encountered       in this field. By documenting my experiences and insights, I hope to create a comprehensive resource that others can use      to learn more about web scraping and avoid some of the common pitfalls that I have encountered.

    *  To accomplish this goal, I plan to develop a variety of strategies and solutions for addressing common issues that             arise during web scraping, including challenges related to data extraction, website access, and parsing. By sharing           my successes, failures, and mistakes, I hope to help others learn from my experiences and develop their own skills in         this area.
     
     *  I welcome the opportunity to collaborate with others and explore new ideas and approaches to web scraping. Ultimately, my goal is to create a useful and informative resource that can help others find success in their own web scraping endeavors.
